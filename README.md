# How to run the App?

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In case you want to run this App, check the following steps.

### 1.) Clone the App
Clone this GitHub repository onto your local machine using "git clone repository-url" command in your Git Bash or using your Git GUI.

### 2.) Install Dependencies
After you successfully cloned the repo on your local machine, you have to install all the dependencies that will enable you to run the App. Inside the cloned directory open your cmd (Command Prompt) and run the command "npm install." To run this command you must have already installed Node.js and Node Package Manager (NPM). In case you don't have these, you can find installation guide [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

### 3.) Run the App
After you have installed all the dependencies, you are ready to run the App. Inside your local app directory, the same one where you have installed the dependencies, open the cmd and type command "npm start." Wait a little bit and this command will run the App and automatically open it in the default browser.
